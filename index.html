        <p> What comes to our minds when we hear the word empower? Why talk about empowerment?
            What is happening to the society today and how does it affect us?
        </p>
            <h3>Empowerment</h3>
            <p>When one is young He/she has no idea of what the future holds rather they live on 
                hope that all their dreams will come true.What happens when they reality of life gets them,when their dreams seams partially shuttered?
                When the have no control over what happens around then ,when they have no choice but to adjust their lives and live a life of denial.
                The community empowerment program tackles some of these  issues.We will have a look at what the program does later on.
            </p>
            <p>Empowerment is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's
                 life and claiming one's rights.Empowerment is all about:

        In my community the number of school drop outs mainly in high school and tertially has risen drasticall
        and thus leading youths to lives they never dreamt of,and some get lost along the way.
        <h3>Some problems our program want to tackle area as follows</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>School droping out</li>
            <p>
                This can be due to poverty,lack of vision,or even issues at home.This program aims to 
                link with programs that support students financially,e.g Wings to fly,Moringae.t.c.The program
                is basically a platform that represent students with their needs fororganisations or well wishers
                to try and make the student dreams come true.
            
            </p>
            <li>Mentorship</li>
            <p>Sometimes student need mentors so as to keep it in line ,they need to hear stories of 
                people who have made it to get motivated.This program aims to give motivation to give  mentorship
                to students,and to connect students with mentors.This will encourage students to work harder.
            </p>
            <li>Drug abuse</li>
            <p>
                Family problems and also personal issues can result to children  and also adult engaging
                in drug abuse.Our program aims to make awareness to students about drug abuse at an early age
